        "Models of cultural evolution posit that culture is information that is transmitted between individuals through various forms of imitation, teaching, and social learning (Boyd and Richerson 1985). This perspective views culture has having a second (or dual) system of inheritance that complements our genetic system of inheritance. This system of inheritance produces a hierarchy of cultural entities that are transmitted between individuals in the form of words, innovations, folk stories, religious beliefs, and social practices to name only a few [(Boyd et al. 1997)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203774380). Given this perspective on cultural inheritance, the first question to ask is whether the same assumptions and methods used to build phylogenies in biology can also be applied to human culture?  In other words, are cultural phylogenies possible?\n",
        "\n",
        "The applicability of cultural phylogenies is largely based on how one views the units of cultural change. If culture is passed from generation to generation (vertical transmission) and remains largely stable through time, cultural phylogenies are likely a valuable tool to examine historical relatedness. If culture is more likely to be passed from peer-to-peer (horizontal transmission) and is unstable through time, phylogenies may not be able to reliably infer relatedness in the past. To learn more about how the units of cultural inheritance impact phylogenies, please watch the short video presented by Dr. Erik Gjesfjeld, available on the hosting web page. \n",

        "\n",
        "Phylogenetic analysis can be performed with a wide variety of data including molecular sequence data, linguistic data, or technological data. However, all data used in a character-based phylogenetic analysis must have two components, the unit of analysis and character data about the unit of analysis. In cultural macroevolution, the unit of analysis is often a population of individuals or products that share common features. For example, this could be group that shares a common language (English), a common ethnicity (Han Chinese), or even a shared technology (a particular house style). For each of these cultural units (or taxa), we also need to identify the variability within the character states. In some cases, this may be as simple as a binary measurement of whether two groups share or do not share a similar word meaning or a cultural trait. In other cases, this might include multiple character states, such as series of projectile point measurements [O'Brien et al. 2002](https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.2002.2548).   \n",

At each archaeological site, at least one house style is characterized by a number of traits including the entrance direction, the number of hearths, or the pattern of wooden posts. In the table below, one house from each archaeological site is characterized by six characters and their multiple corresponding character state. For instance, the first character is the layout of interior posts (IntPost) with character states being 1 = Circular, 2 = Square / Rectangle, 3 = Linear, 4 = Double Linear. \n",

This assumption may be more controversial for some sources of cultural data than others, as discussed below. \n",

        "A majority of phylogenetic analyses currently rely on model-based methods to construct trees. These methods use a mathematical description of evolutionary change within the characters, referred to as a \"model\". Broadly speaking, this model is the researcher's hypothesis about the mechanisms that influence evolutionary history. \n",

        "In the house style data set presented above, the data can be considered as discrete, unordered data. As [Harmon (2018)](https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/) highlights, the most basic model for modeling changes in discrete characters is known as the Mk model. The model was originally developed by [Pagel (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1994.0006.), although the name Mk comes from [Lewis (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1080/106351501753462876.) and is a direct analogue of the Jukes-Cantor (JC) model used in molecular sequences [(Harmon 2018)](https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/). \n",

The basic Mk Model also assumes that it is equally likely to change between any other states. If we use the house style data presented above, the transitions between character states for the first character would look something like this and can be summarized using a transition rate matrix:\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to note that the Mk model assumes that transitions among all possible character states can also occur at the same rate. However, this may not be a valid assumption for cultural or biological data. A range of other models do exist that fit more complex transition scenarios and will be discussed below. \n",

        "The earliest character based method for inferring phylogeny was the parsimony method [(Dunn 2015).](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315794013) The parsimony assumption, often associated with a cladistic approach, can be viewed as the criterion for identifying which tree topology (e.g. the configuration and length of branches) is the most appropriate. The parsimony assumption aims to find the tree that minimizes the number of character changes required to produce the observed characters states in the data. The use of a cladistic approach in cultural evolution has been particularly prevalant with archaeological data with extensive details about cladistics and archaeology found in O'Brien and Lyman (2003). \n",
        "\n",
        "One potential issue in using parsimony methods is when there is potential for long branches (branches with lots of change). Often these branches might end up clustered together when they are actually quite distantly related [(Dunn 2015)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315794013). This is because the most parsimonious solution to the tree topology would be to place these branches closer to each other.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A more recent approach uses likelihood methods to estimate the tree topology. These methods aim to explain a set of data by quantifying how likely it was that the observed data were produced by a particular process [(Dunn 2015).](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315794013) This process can be written as the likelihood ($L$) of seeing the data ($D$) under a particular hypothesis ($H$). The hypothesis ($H$) in a phylogenetic context is the chosen model of character change (e.g. the Mk model discussed above).\n",
        "\n",
        "$$L = P(D|H)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing the best tree when using likelihood methods proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the parameters in the tree. These parameters are most likely to be branch lengths, transition values, etc. While calculating the likelihood is mathematically tractable for a tree with a small number of cultural units or taxa (languages, ethnic groups, technological products), it quickly become very difficult when trees get larger. For trees that have only 40 cultural units, there are more possible tree configurations ($1.0985*10^{57}$) than atoms in the entire world! ($1.33*10^{50}$)\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common solution to this exponential problem is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the possible trees that have the highest likelihoods. We talk about MCMC methods in other tutorials, but briefly just know that MCMC chains start at a random point in the space of all possible trees, moves through different tree configurations, and compares the likelihood of the current tree with the previous tree. If the new tree has a higher likelihood score, the MCMC chain moves towards it. This process continues millions of times as the MCMC chain slowly climbs towards trees with the highest likelihoods.

The words chosen to construct the phylogeny are those considered to be generally stable over time and less likely to be borrowed between languages (see video lecture above for greater details on core versus package traits). From this database, a set of homologous words, known as cognates, were identified for 400 well-known Austronesian languages [(Gray, Drummond and Greenhill 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1166858). Broadly speaking, the unit of analysis for this tree is the ethno-linguistic group, meaning a population in which all individuals speak the same language and also have a shared history.

In the modeling of language evolution, models of language change can range from simple to more complex depending on knowledge about the data. Here, a simple model would be a single parameter that represents the rate of change between the presence or absence of a cognate set (i.e. shared word meaning) (Greenhill and Gray 2009). We can also have a more complex and realistic model that would have a parameter for the ease of losing a cognate and a separate one for the ease of gaining a cognate. This might be useful as it is probably easier for a cognate set to be lost after it has arisen than for another ethno-linguistic group to independently derive the same cognate set. A model of language change that allows cognates to be lost many times but gained only once is known as a stochastic Dollo model. \n",

More recent phylogenetic approaches can test between multiple models of character change and identify which model settings best fit the observed data (see [Gjesfjeld and Jordan 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11117-5_9).  \n",

Broadly speaking, the posterior distribution contains the trees that have the highest likelihoods and fit the data well given the data and priors (Greenhill and Gray 2009). In the creation of the Austronesian language phylogeny presented above, the MCMC was run for 100 million generations across six replicates with sampling of trees every 100,000 generations. The first 40 million generations (burn-in) [(Gray, Drummond and Greenhill 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1166858) were discarded as the early trees sampled are strongly influenced by the starting values of the model.

However, knowing the historical relatedness between groups also helps us to solve another question, often known as **Galton's Problem**. The central issue of Galton's Problem is that cultural groups cannot be treated as independent from each other when being compared against each other [(Mace and Pagel 1994)](https://doi.org/10.1086/204317). This is because similar cultural groups might be similar because they have a shared ancestor and not because they independently developed the same traits. In general, phylogenies are advantageous to the comparison of cultures as they help control for *Galton's Problem* of autocorrelation. In other words, a cultural phylogeny helps to control for the influence of shared cultural history when comparing the similarities or differences between two or more cultural groups.  \n",

Most interesting is that numerous ethno-linguistic groups with social stratification also demonstrate human sacrifice.

        "Another contribution of phylogenetic comparative methods is their ability to estimate the traits of groups in the past, known as ancestral state reconstruction. Here this is done using a very simple method called 'ACE' from the `ape` package in R. This is provided here for demonstration purposes only and the reader is encouraged to explore more sophisticated and more appropriate methods for reconstructing ancestral states, such as those used by [Watts et al.

The trait seems to appear only twice, in the ancestor of the Tongan and Samoan groups and in the ancestor of the Rarotongan, Hawaiian, and Tahitian groups. Maori represents an interesting example as it probably should demonstrate high social stratification given its ancestry, but it does not. This indicates that it likely lost this trait after the split from its related cultural groups.  \n",

This method uses a stochastic mapping procedure for reconstructing the history of a trait. Here, we use a simple equal rates (ER) model which assumes homogeneous rates of change across the tree. Broadly speaking, we are simulating 100 different character histories across the tree conditioned on transitions between characters in our data. We can then visualize a sample of character changes across 100 simulated histories. It is important to note that this procedure is not the same as fitting a model of heterogeneous rates through time, something that we will highlight in later tutorials.  \n",

Here, we subset the tree into 20 different time segments and plot the average changes for each segment through time. The result generally shows an increase in the number of changes between 1,500 and 1,000 years ago and again from 500 years ago to the present. The sharp rise closer to the present is relatively unsurprising, as we would expect more changes to accumulate towards the present when we use an equal rates model. This is because the overall branch length becomes greater in those parts of the tree.\n",

        "\n",
        "Despite the ubiquity of phylogenetic approaches in studies of macroevolution, a tree-based approach may not always be the best option for certain types of data or macroevolutionary questions. For example, in their study of material culture artifacts, [Tëmkin and Eldredge (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1086/510463.) suggest that \"Traditional phylogenetic analyses have rather limited application where traditional transmission is strong  but intercultural exchange is weak\". As indicated above, core vocabulary words are more likely to have strong vertical transmission and change less over time (i.e. cultural cores). However, traits associated with material culture or different technologies are potential candidates to change more quickly (i.e. cultural packages). Some studies have shown strong temporal continuity within material culture [(Tehrani and Collard 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0278-4165(02)00002-8), [Lipo et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203786376)), whereas other studies have also shown a tendency for strong horizontal transmission within material culture [(Tëmkin and Eldredge 2007](https://doi.org/10.1086/510463.), [Borgerhoff-Mulder et al. 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1002/evan.20088). Broadly speaking, the long-term and vertical transmission of cultural traits is likely to differ significantly between cultural domains and should always be considered prior to the application of phylogenetic methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the concerns above, phylogenies can also be unreliable in circumstances when there is potential for a high degree of turnover and when a small number of cultural lineages persist to the current time period. These conditions could be met when examining technological or material culture, which can change quickly over time and as well as discarded. In these circumstances, archaeological or historical data on material culture can still be used to investigate changes in diversity through time but a different conceptual and methodological approach needs to be taken. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the remaining tutorials, we will introduce users to an alternative macroevolutionary framework that can examine the mode and tempo of cultural evolution using historical and material data. This approach complements phylogenetic methods, but does not require the same assumptions and therefore provides flexibility in the type of data that can be examined. \n",
