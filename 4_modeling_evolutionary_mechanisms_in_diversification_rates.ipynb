Subclasses inherit all of the attributes and methods (functions that can use attributes of the object). The only other notable thing here is the keyword `self` which refers to the object itself in it's definition. \"self\" can be used to reference attributes defined when the object is initialized, and must be the first argument in any method definition.

From a macroevolutionary perspective, we can imagine **key innovations** as those that expand the scope of a cultural form and/or open the form to a new audience, thus creating new space for other representations to circulate. This parallels the notion of key innovations in biological evolution; such innovations open up new niches for a taxonomic group. \n",

For new music genres, we can imagine a rapid churn of ideas being and born and dying until the sonic, aesthetic, and social parameters of the new genre become clear.

The detailed interpretation of cultural carrying capacity varies from question to question, but we can imagine it as the total resources available to actors to sustain the cultural form. These resources might have economic, social, and/or cognitive dimensions. For example, if our form is a population of firms in the same market, we might imagine them competing for economic resources. If our form consists of artists or scientists within a social field, we can imagine the carrying capacity in terms of some field-specific capital (Bourdieu 1996, Kahn-Harris 2006). On some level, all cultural lineages are competing for the limited time, attention, motivation, and memory of actors to reproduce, circulate, and sustain the cultural form [(Koch et al, in progress)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/659bt). *Most of the evolutionary mechanisms described below are contingent on this concept of a cultural carrying capacity.*\n",

Rates from the diversity-dependence models (solid lines and 95% high posterior density intervals) are plotted on top of the empirical rates (dashed lines). In Panel A, the parameter $K$ (the carrying capacity) is an estimated parameter that doesn't change over time. In Panel B, we have made $K$ grow parametrically according to the estimated parameters of a logistic growth curve. \n",

        "In the static carrying capacity model, estimated birth rates seem to track empirical birth rates closely from 1987-2000. These diversity-dependent rates also track the LiteRate rates, albeit averaging over the rate shelf in Phase 4 (Figure in last module; not shown here). When we allow the carrying capacity to grow according to a logistic niche curve, the diversity-dependent rates track the observed rates roughly throughout the genre's entire history from Phase 1-5. We find this explanation compelling. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that neither of these models suggest that death rates are driven by competition. However, death rates are comparatively much smaller than birth rates in this population, suggesting that this is a birth-driven process. This is obvious in the net diversification rates (not shown).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we interpret the carrying capacity as time, attention, motivation, and memory that actors (e.g. musicians, fans, and anyone who has some conception of the term \"Metal\") have to consume and develop the cultural representations and objects that give the genre meaning. Collectively, these lineages bound the musical, aesthetic, and social parameters that delineate \"Metal\" bands from \"not Metal: bands. This cultural carrying capacity doesn't stymie new bands from being formed; it simply prevents them from being collectively understood by actors as Metal bands.\n",
        "\n",
        "We model the carrying capacity as growing according to a logistic niche because it takes a critical mass of bands to concretize the parameters of the genre and spread them to an appreciable number of actors. These early bands can be viewed as key innovations. Once this happens, the number of bands that the population of actors can collectively understand as Metal is bounded not by the number of listeners (assuredly increasing over time), but the ability of the population to share a broad understanding of what Metal means without losing coherence. See the paper for further analyses supporting this interpretation and exploring the cause of the rate shelf in Phase 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cool thing about these diversity-dependence models is that they provide quantitative estimates of the theoretical carrying capacity. In the figure below, we plot these carrying capacities over time along with the standing diversity. Although the carrying capacity was estimated only from data in 1968-2000, the observed standing diversity in the dataset hasn't reached this theoretical capacity by 2016. We caution over-interpretation here because the HPD intervals are quite large and curatorial biases are probably depressing the standing diversity in recent years, but it is still neat to see.\n",
