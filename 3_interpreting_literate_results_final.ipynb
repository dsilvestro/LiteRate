        "\n",
        "- Phase 1 (1968-1978): Experimentation by early/proto- Metal bands where birth rates start high, decline, and begin to rise again. This trend is observable in the empirical rates and, to a lesser extent, in the LiteRate-estimated rates. There are few bands active during this period, leading to high uncertainty around the LiteRate estimates as indicated by large shaded areas (95% highest posterior density intervals or HPDs). One possible interpretation is that rates start out high as the first-generation of bands emerges, but slow down as the sonic, aesthetic, and social parameters have not yet been concretized.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Phase 2 (1978-1981): By 1978, the genre form solidifies (a key innovation) and there is sharp growth through 1981, coupled with increased turnover as bands rapidly explore the genre space (Phase 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Phase 3 (1981-1988): From 1981-1984, birth rates are stable and high, while death rates rise. In biology, the rapid churn of species early in a clade’s history has been interpreted as necessary for clades to build a \"standing diversity” of fit species that stabilize the clade’s existence. From 1984-1988, birth rates fall while death rates stabilize. The overall signature of converging birth and death rates in Phase 3, called *diversity dependent diversification*, is interpreted in biology as consistent with competition. We test this hypothesis in the next module (Interpreting Evolutionary Signatures). \n",
        "\n",
        "- Phase 4 (1988-1993): Birth and death rates stabilize, in between two periods of possible competition.\n",
        "- Phase 5 (1993-2000): This phase begins with another diversity dependence-like signature, before both birth and death rates slow, ossifying the stable of bands that make up the Metal genre. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most striking patterns in this data is that not only are birth rates greater than death rates *on average*, they are *always* greater than death rates. Moreover, while there is some range in death rates, they are not nearly as dynamic, suggesting that this is a birth driven process. \n",
        "\n",
        "A second puzzle is that the two periods of apparent competition (Phases 3, 5) are separated by a shelf with stable rates (Phase 4). The first possible interpretation of Phases 3-5 is that there is global competition operating from the genre's solidification in the early 1980s through 2000, and that Phase 4 is a momentary contextual deviation from this process. The second interpretation is that Phase 4 separates two independent periods of competition, potentially by two different groups of bands. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is interesting to note that Phase 4 also corresponds with Metal's peak in commercial appeal. This suggests that, at least for the majority of bands, the rise of Grunge music during this same time period did not cause a significant extinction in the Metal genre (although it may have for a subset of bands). However, the contraction in rates associated with the later Phase 5 coincides with what scholars call the Metal \"Dark Ages\" in the second half of the 1990s after the fall from pop music (Kahn-Harris 2006).\n",
