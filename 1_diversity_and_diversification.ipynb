However, over the historical time scales of interest in macroevolution, archaeology, history, and cultural/historical sociology, we may not have reliable estimates of the number things within a lineage. For example, it is difficult to know how many pots were manufactured in a particular style or how many people shared a cultural trait, value, or practice.

Since their introduction in the late 19th century, automobiles have radically changed how people move, where people live, and even the global climate.

In addition, car models have an established classification/categorization scheme that has emerged throughout the history of the automotive industry. The benefits of using an established classification scheme is that we do not need to quantify all the traits of each car model, as would be required for phylogenetic analysis; we only need to know the starting and ending years of production (occurrence data) for each car model. \n",

        "Diversification rates simply provide more information into the processes underlying changes in diversity than diversity indices. For example, one could hypothesize that each of the three diversification scenarios presented above represent a different set of underlying cultural, economic or social processes.\n",

        "In any of these circumstances, understanding the relationship between origination and extinction rates is imperative to gaining further insight into processes driving the patterns of diversity. This is clear when we view the diversification of American automobiles from 1896-2018 (shown below), as opposed to simply the change in car model richness over time (shown above). By estimating both origination and extinction rates, we are able to identify historical periods in which both rates were impacted (Great Depression, WWII) and those in which only one was impacted (Arab Oil Crisis, 2008 Recession). Furthermore, we can also identify with far greater clarity the timing of significant shifts in either origination and extinction rates, which are highlighted in the figure below from [Gjesfjeld et al.(2020)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227579.)\n",

        "\n",
        "Diversification rates capture how cultural lineages \"beget\" other lineages through learning and innovation by people, as well as how cultural lineages \"die\" from disuse and forgetting. They do not make strong assumptions about individual-level circumstances (as in agent-based simulations), or the exact sequence of transmission and variation events (as in networks and phylogenies). Diversification rates consider the entire population or cultural form without privileging some lineages as more important than others. We all have our own heterogeneous personal cultures in which some representations and things are more relevant than others, so in many cases this is a reasonable simplifying assumption. However, it is a strong assumption and should be evaluated in context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Diversification rate analyses of cultural lineages should be considered as a complement, not a competitor, to actor-based analyses like social network analysis or agent-based simulations. While those methods start from actor-level transmission processes to extrapolate population-scale cultural outcomes, diversification rate analysis takes the opposite approach. Diversification rate analysis starts from population-level cultural phenomena and identifies trends that are consistent with individual-level processes occurring. This approach can be helpful in corroborating simulations, or when actor-level structural data simply aren't available.\n",
